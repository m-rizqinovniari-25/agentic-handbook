title: "Mengenal Lebih Dalam Mengenai Agentic AI: Principles, Design, and Real-World Applications"
description: "This learning material provides an in-depth and systematic exploration of Agentic AI, focusing on systems capable of autonomous decision-making, goal formulation, planning, and continuous interaction with their environments. The material bridges theoretical foundations with practical implementation, enabling learners to understand not only how agentic systems work, but why they behave the way they do.

Designed for an intermediate audience, the content progressively moves from core concepts and historical roots to advanced design patterns, implementation strategies, evaluation methods, and ethical considerations. By the end of this material, learners will be capable of designing, implementing, and critically evaluating Agentic AI systems in real-world contexts."
