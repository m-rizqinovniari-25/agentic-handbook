title: "Deep Dive into Agentic AI: Concepts, Design, and Real-World Applications"
description: "This learning material provides an in-depth exploration of Agentic AI, a paradigm of artificial intelligence systems capable of autonomous goal-setting, planning, decision-making, and action execution. The material goes beyond traditional AI and machine learning concepts to focus on agents that can reason, adapt, and operate in dynamic environments with minimal human intervention.

Designed for intermediate-level learners, this content bridges theoretical foundations and practical implementation. Learners will gain a solid understanding of how agentic systems are structured, how they differ from reactive or purely model-based AI, and how they are being applied across industries. The material emphasizes design trade-offs, ethical considerations, and future directions to prepare learners for both development and critical evaluation of Agentic AI systems."
