# Part I: Foundations and Core Concepts of Agentic AI

This part introduces the conceptual and theoretical foundations of Agentic AI. It clarifies what makes an AI system agentic, traces its intellectual roots, and explains the core components that enable autonomous goal-directed behavior. The chapters establish a shared vocabulary and mental models necessary for deeper technical and practical discussions in later parts.
