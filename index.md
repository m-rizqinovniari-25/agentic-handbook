# Agentic AI: Foundations, Design, and Real-World Applications

This comprehensive learning material explores Agentic AI—AI systems capable of autonomous goal setting, decision-making, and action execution within dynamic environments. The material is designed to help learners move from foundational concepts to advanced design and implementation practices, with a strong emphasis on reasoning, planning, tools use, and autonomy.

Through in-depth chapters, learners will understand how Agentic AI differs from traditional AI systems, how agent architectures are built, and how such systems are deployed, evaluated, and governed in real-world scenarios. The content balances theory, system design, and practical considerations, making it suitable for professionals and advanced learners seeking a deep understanding of modern AI agents.
