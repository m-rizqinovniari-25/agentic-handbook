# Part II: Design and Implementation of Agentic AI Systems

This part focuses on how Agentic AI systems are designed and built in practice. It connects conceptual understanding with modern architectures, frameworks, and workflows. Learners will explore how large language models enable agentic behavior and how to structure, orchestrate, and evaluate intelligent agents in applied settings.
